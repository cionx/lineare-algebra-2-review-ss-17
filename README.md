# _Lineare Algebra II_ Review, SS 17

These are materials for a review course for the lecture _Lineare Algebra II_, which was held at the University of Bonn during the summer semester of 2017.
This review course was held at the end of the semester as a preparation for the upcoming second exam, and was provided by the [Fachschaft Mathematik][1].
The course took place over five days, for a total of 20 hours.

The materials consist of a short summary of the lecture (`notes.pdf`), as well as one exercise sheet for each of the five days (`sheet_1.pdf` to `sheet_5.pdf`.)
Downloads are available via the following links:

-  [notes.pdf][2]
-  [sheet_1.pdf][3]
-  [sheet_2.pdf][4]
-  [sheet_3.pdf][5]
-  [sheet_4.pdf][6]
-  [sheet_5.pdf][7]


Solutions to the exercises were developed during the review sessions by the participants, and are therefore mostly absent from the materials themselves.

All materials are in German.
